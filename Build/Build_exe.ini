; NOTES:
; By default, the desktop shortcut name is the directory name that is packaged ...
; If RemovePre & RemovePost are blank, the remove shortcut will show directory name with a minus after it, like "SCPrompt -". This is done to ensure the two icons have different names (and therefore the remove will not overwrite the Start, unless you name them the same of course)

; By adding text to the following, we can name the shortcut to start the app "Start SCPrompt"
ShortcutStartPre=

; By adding text to the following, we can name the shortcut to start the app "SCPrompt Start"
ShortcutStartPost=Start

; By adding text to the following, we can name the shortcut to remove the app "Remove SCPrompt"
ShortcutRemovePre=

; By adding text to the following, we can name the shortcut to remove the app "SCPrompt Remove"
ShortcutRemovePost=Remove
